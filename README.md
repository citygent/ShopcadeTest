# Shopping Show Page Front End Test

Was asked to do this after an interview which didn't go great cus froze up on basic developer-tools question.

##Task:
Mock-up structure and style from a PSD. 

I gave myself two hours, and am clearly a bit rusty with something that has to work across browsers. Kept wanting to use flexbox. 


##Things to improve on:
You lost a lot of time extracting images from the PSD. Now you're a web developer you should try to build a script that will do this for you (and resize/crop layers accordingly). 

Take a notebook so you can sketch out div layout/skeleton. Lost a lot of time on not noticing the content div was nested in the wrong place. 

CALM DOWN. ASK FOR CLARIFICATION. DON'T PANIC.
